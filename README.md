# Azure-Project
This repository involves project details of Integrated Analytics with Azure Synapse Analytics.
In this Project I Built a Pipeline and explored data analytics workspace using Azure Synapse Analytics and Azure Synapse Analytics workspace as a resource in Azure Synapse 
Analytics for Integrated Data Analytics.

Found out solutions for 3 problem statements which included,
a) Ingesting dataset from an external resource(HTTP), transforming the dataset and storing the transformed data into 
   ADLS Gen-2(Azure Data-lake Storage Generation 2) storage.
b) Exploring datahub and performing SQL queries on top of transformed data and visualize the result set.
c) Creating Apache Spark Pool, performing operations and with the help of chart view getting visual information and valuable insights from the result set.
